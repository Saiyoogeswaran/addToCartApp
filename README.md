## How It Works ??

1. Introducing the "Add to Cart App"! This app is designed to make your shopping experience more convenient by allowing you to easily add and remove items from your virtual cart. 

2. The app is built using HTML, CSS, JS and Firebase. HTML and CSS are utilized for designing the user interface, while JS provides the dynamic interaction between you and the app. Finally, Firebase is used to store and retrieve your shopping cart data from the database. 

3. To add an item, simply enter the name of the desired product in the input text box. To remove an item, just double-click on the item you want to delete. 

4. This is a basic "Add To Cart App" and feel free to suggest any changes that you feel would make the app even better.
